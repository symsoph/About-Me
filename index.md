## The _Real_ Me<sup>HAha</sup>
Hello! I'm Sofia, striving to be a **game dev**, because I love all the ways the arts come together with technology to create an interactive, memorable, and enjoyable product. Really, I am chasing a career that allows me to express my creativity as an artist and musician and to think logically.  Hopefully, it's game dev but I am learning about other career paths like those in sound engineering and UI/UX design.
